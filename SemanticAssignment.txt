HTML5 introduced several new features and improvements over its predecessors, HTML4 and XHTML. Some of the key new features introduced in HTML5 include:

Semantics: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <figure>. These elements provide clearer structure to web documents, making it easier for search engines, screen readers, and developers to understand the content and its context.

Multimedia Support: HTML5 introduced native support for audio and video elements (<audio> and <video>), allowing developers to embed media content directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

Canvas: HTML5 introduced the <canvas> element, which provides a 2D drawing API for dynamically rendering graphics, charts, animations, and other visualizations directly within the browser using JavaScript.

SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) support was improved in HTML5, enabling developers to embed vector graphics directly into web pages using the <svg> element. This allows for scalable, resolution-independent graphics that can be manipulated and animated using CSS and JavaScript.

Geolocation: HTML5 introduced the Geolocation API, which allows web applications to access a user's geographical location (with their permission) through their device's GPS or other location-sensing mechanisms.

Local Storage: HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which allow web applications to store data locally on the user's device. This provides a way to persist data across sessions without relying on server-side storage or cookies.

Offline Web Applications: HTML5 introduced the Application Cache (AppCache) and Service Workers, enabling developers to create web applications that can work offline or in low-connectivity environments by caching resources and handling network requests programmatically.

Form Controls: HTML5 introduced several new input types (<input type="date">, <input type="email">, <input type="url">, etc.) and attributes (such as required, pattern, min, max, etc.) for form elements, making it easier to create user-friendly and semantically meaningful forms.

Web Workers: HTML5 introduced the Web Workers API, which allows developers to run JavaScript code in background threads separate from the main execution thread. This enables parallel processing and improves the responsiveness of web applications, especially for CPU-intensive tasks.

Websockets: HTML5 introduced the WebSocket API, which enables bidirectional communication between web clients and servers over a single, long-lived TCP connection. This allows for real-time, low-latency data exchange between the client and server, making it well-suited for applications like online gaming, chat applications, and live data streaming.
